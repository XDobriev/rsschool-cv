## I am **26** I've always been good at tech, but the first time I thought about becoming a software engineer was after yet another failed attempt to find my calling at university. I returned to my homeland, to Ingushetia.

## The first year was interrupted by various jobs not related to IT. However, for the past year I have been working as a full-time IT specialist in the largest resort in our region. I deal with all the software, setting up automation between different departments. The work is interesting and the experience gained is invaluable.

## Maybe I would have continued to stay in this company, but my recent marriage opened up new goals for me and made me look at life in a new way.
## Now the desire to provide the family with everything necessary prevails over everything.
## My goal is to become a frontend developer. May Allah help me on this path.

## At the moment my stack looks like this - HTML5, CSS3, SASS, WordPress, Basic JS, a little PHP, GIT, Figma, Adobe Illustrator.

## Unfortunately, I don't have much experience. Several pet-projects, ToDo, several layouts.
## As I study, I will add projects in this CV.
